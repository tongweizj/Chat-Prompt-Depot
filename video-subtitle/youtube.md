What's Wrong Eric I'm really nervous I'm

always this way on the first day of

school you're not the only one it's hard

for me too I'm glad we're taking this

class together do you know anything

about the teacher uh-huh a little

someone told me she gives a lot of

homework and you have to talk a lot in

class oh no I'm afraid of talking in

front of a lot of people oh don't worry

everyone's afraid at the beginning but

after you get to know the people and

make friends it doesn't get better for

me I'm shy

I have trouble looking at people when I

talk and my hands shake

look the teachers here let's talk after
